                            Tradix is an instant cryptocurrency exchange that
                            allows you to exchange crypto fast and buy it with a
                            bank card. The service provides the best
                            crypto-to-crypto rates and supports over 140
                            cryptocurrencies available for exchange

                        <h3>How does Tradix work?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Tradix’s trading algorithm is integrated into the
                            largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including
                            Binance, Poloniex, Bittrex, etc. In the span of
                            milliseconds, Tradix makes bids and asks on the
                            platforms, then selects and suggests the best
                            available rate and displays the estimated rate on
                            our site. The rates remain approximate until the
                            transaction is actually made on the blockchain,
                            which is why the exchange rate at the time of a
                            transaction may differ slightly from the estimated
                            rate that you see when you begin a process, see this

                            longer be affected by the risks associated with
                            crypto market fluctuations. Soon, the fixed-rate

                            needs to click on the lock icon, which will result
                            in them getting the exact same amount of crypto as

                            minutes, which should be more than enough to carry
